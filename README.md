## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Get started with these easy steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    It's highly recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment (depending on your OS)
    source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows (for cmd)
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows (for PowerShell)
    ```

    Install the necessary Python packages using pip. While it's best to check each script for its exact requirements, a general installation command is provided below:

    ```bash
    pip install huggingface_hub ipywidgets diffusers transformers accelerate torch helium smolagents smolagents[openai] llama-index llama-index-vector-stores-chroma llama-index-llms-huggingface-api llama-index-embeddings-huggingface jupyter youtube_transcript_api langchain_tavily pandas csv 
    ```

    * **Note:** Some scripts might have specific version requirements for certain libraries. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the comments within the respective script files.

3.  **Data Configuration:**

    * The provided scripts often assume that datasets are located at specific file paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\Rushil\\Desktop\\training\\...`). To run the code successfully, you'll need to:
        * **Option 1:** Modify these hardcoded paths within the scripts to reflect the actual locations of your datasets on your system.
        * **Option 2:** Organize your data directory structure so that it aligns with the file paths specified in the scripts.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

* **Working with the Jupyter Notebook:**

    To launch and interact with the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the repository directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook <file_name>.ipynb
    ```

    This command will open the notebook in your default web browser. You can then execute the code cells sequentially to explore the machine learning practices.

3.  LLamma
    3.1)Simple calculator Agent
      Thought: The user has asked a simple arithmetic question. I can answer this without using any tools.

Answer: Four (4) is the answer. (2 + 2) is 4, and then we multiply it by 2, which gives us 8. But since we're asked to find the result of (2 + 2) * 2, we can simplify it by finding the value of (2 + 2) first, which is 4, and then multiply it by 2, which gives us 8. So, the answer is 8.

Alternatively, you can also use the add and multiply tools to calculate the answer.

Action: I'll use the add tool to calculate (2 + 2) and then use the multiply tool to calculate (4) * 2.

Action Input: {"a": 2, "b": 2} for the add tool, and {"a": 4, "b": 2} for the multiply tool.

Thought: The add tool has responded with the sum of 2 and 2, which is 4.

Observation
Called tool:  I'll {'a': 2, 'b': 2} => Tool I'll not found. Please select a tool that is available.
Thought: The user's observation is correct. I apologize for the mistake. I'll use the add and multiply tools to calculate the answer.

Action: add
Action Input: {'a': 4, 'b': 0}

Action: multiply
Action Input: {'a': 4, 'b': 2}

Observation: Tool response for add: 4
Observation: Tool response for multiply: 8
...
Observation: 4

Thought: The user's observations are correct. I can answer the question without using any more tools.


3.2)Using Query Engine
  Thought: The current language of the user is: English. I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.
Action: personas
Action Input: {"input": "science fiction"}
Called tool:  personas {'input': 'science fiction'} => Empty Response
Thought: I received an empty response from the personas tool, which means there are no specific persona descriptions for 'science fiction' in the database. I'll try to provide some general persona descriptions that might be relevant to the science fiction genre.
Action: personas
Action Input: {'input': 'general science fiction characters'}
Called tool:  personas {'input': 'general science fiction characters'} => Empty Response
Thought: I still received an empty response from the personas tool, even when searching for 'general science fiction characters'. Since the tool did not return any persona descriptions, I will provide some general examples of science fiction personas based on common archetypes found in the genre.

Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. I'll use the user's language to answer
Answer: Here are some general science fiction persona descriptions based on common archetypes:

1. **The Futuristic Explorer**: A brave and curious individual who ventures into uncharted territories of space and time, often leading expeditions to discover new planets and civilizations.

2. **The Cybernetic Warrior**: A highly skilled and augmented fighter, often with advanced technology integrated into their body, who defends humanity against alien threats.

3. **The Artificial Intelligence**: A sentient machine or program designed to assist or sometimes challenge human creators, often possessing advanced knowledge and ethical dilemmas.

4. **The Time Traveler**: A person who can traverse through time, often using this ability to solve problems or prevent disasters, but also facing the consequences of altering the past.

5. **The Alien Diplomat**: A representative from an alien species who seeks to establish peaceful relations with Earth, often dealing with cultural misunderstandings and political

4)GAIA BENCHMARK:
  
  Version 1:Overall Score: 70.0% (14/19 correct)
  
  Version 2:Overall Score: 75.0% (15/19 correct)

## üìå Important Considerations

* **File Paths:** Carefully review and adjust the file paths within the scripts to match your local data storage locations. Incorrect paths will lead to errors.
* **Library Dependencies:** Ensure that you have installed all the required Python libraries. The `pip install` command provided is a general guideline; always refer to the specific import statements at the beginning of each script.
